# Linkfire-Analysis

Hi! I have added two Jupyter Notebook file, one for Python and one for SQL, for the first presentation.

For the second presentation, I have added a ppt file made from google slides.

For the third presentation, I have added a powerBI file. I know I was supposed to add something using Miro or Figma but this is way better.

For the second and third presentation it's better to use a visualization software like Tableau or PowerBI as reports/dashboards from them are highly interactive and can display multiple data tables/charts at once including live maps.

As an example, here is the screenshot:

Here the events and dates can be toggled to get some specific metrics.
